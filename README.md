# LiteComponent

An ultralight weight HTML5 Custom Element for the modern web, that provides Component semantics with the highest possible performance, highest possible flexibility, lowest possible cognitive and abstractive overhead, depending only on the W3C standard with < 1KB file size (more like 800 bytes, really).

In other words, it saves you a lot of time and headache, being super simple to learn and use, while staying future-proof.
